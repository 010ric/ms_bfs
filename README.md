# MultiSourceGraphTraversal

Examining the research paper "The More the Merrier: Efficient Multi-Source Graph Traversal" by Prof.Neumann, Prof. Kemper, Moritz Kaufmann, Manuel Then et al. (Link: https://db.in.tum.de/~kaufmann/papers/msbfs.pdf).

Optimize the runtime execution for multiple BFSs.

# Data collection

Trying to collect three different sources of data:
a) social media data e.g. twitter, facebook, linked data benchmark coundcil social-network-benchmark: http://ldbcouncil.org/developer/snb
        --> https://graphalytics.org/datasets
b) road network data
        --> http://networkrepository.com/road.php, using road-luxembours-osm.mtx and road-minnesota.mtx
c) biology dataset
